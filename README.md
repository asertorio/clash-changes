# ACC Clash Changes Dashboard

A modern web-based dashboard for reviewing and analyzing clash detection changes in Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) projects. This tool provides an intuitive interface for tracking resolved, modified, and new clashes, along with their related project documentation.

## Features

### ðŸ“Š Dashboard Views

**Report View** - Executive summary and narrative report organized by clash status with recommendations

**Clashes View** - Sortable/filterable table with detailed side panel for clash analysis

**Related Items View** - Groups clashes by their related documentation (RFIs, Change Orders, Forms, Assets)

### ðŸŽ¨ Key Capabilities

- Three theme options: Dark, Light, and Glass (Apple-inspired frosted glass effects)
- Direct links to ACC issues and related documentation
- Screenshot previews with hover tooltips and full-screen modal
- Search and filter functionality across all views
- Drag & drop JSON file support
- Print/PDF export for reports
- Overdue issue highlighting

## Running Locally

### Simple Setup

1. Place all files in the same folder:
   - `clash_dashboard.html`
   - `clashes_update_summary.json`
   - Screenshot images (`.jpg` files)

2. Double-click `clash_dashboard.html` to open in your browser

3. Use the **Update** button to load the JSON file manually

4. Or drag and drop a JSON file onto the page

**Note**: The JSON file will not load automatically on startup. You must manually load it using the Update button or drag-and-drop feature.

## Creating Your Own Data with ACC APIs

For those who would like to recreate this workflow with their own ACC project data, the sample data was generated using the Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) APIs. Here's the workflow:

### 1. Retrieve Clash Information

**Get Model Sets** (groupings of models clashed against each other)
```
GET /modelsets
```
[API Documentation](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/mc-modelset-service-v3-get-model-sets-GET/)

**Get Clash Groups** within the model set
```
GET /modelsets/:modelSetId/clashes/assigned
```
[API Documentation](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/mc-clash-service-v3-search-container-issue-clash-groups-GET/)

This returns the ID of the issue associated with each grouping of clashes.

### 2. Retrieve Related Project Items

Use the issue ID to find related project items (RFIs, Change Orders, Forms, Assets) that are linked to the clash through the issue relationship:

```
POST /relationships:intersect
```
[API Documentation](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/relationship-service-v2-intersect-relationships-POST/)

### 3. Retrieve Clash Snapshots (Screenshots)

**Get Issues** to retrieve the snapshotUrn
```
GET /issues
```
[API Documentation](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/issues-issues-GET/)

**Download Snapshot** using the snapshotUrn
```
GET /buckets/:bucketKey/objects/:objectKey/signeds3download
```
[API Documentation](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/buckets-:bucketKey-objects-:objectKey-signeds3download-GET/)

### 4. Get Detailed Clash Data from CSVs

Individual clash group information comes from CSV spreadsheets generated by clash tests.

**Get Clash Tests** for the model set
```
GET /modelsets/:modelSetId/tests
```
[API Documentation](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/mc-clash-service-v3-get-model-set-clash-tests-GET/)

**Get Test Resources** (CSV URLs) for specific clash tests
```
GET /tests/:testId/resources
```
[API Documentation](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/reference/http/mc-clash-service-v3-get-clash-test-resources-GET/)

The `scope-version-clash.2.0.0` CSV contains the detailed clash information needed.

### Data Flow Summary

```
Clashes â†’ Clash Groups â†’ Issues â†’ Related Items
```

1. Individual clashes are grouped into **Clash Groups**
2. Each Clash Group is associated with an **Issue** in ACC
3. Issues can have **Related Items** (RFIs, Change Orders, Forms, Assets)
4. The dashboard displays this hierarchy with full traceability

### Resources

- [Model Coordination Field Guide](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/overview/field-guide/model-coordination/mcfg-model-set/) - Detailed guide on Model Set structure and clash data
- [ACC API Overview](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/overview/) - Full API documentation

### Note on Data Processing

The sample JSON file (`clashes_update_summary.json`) is a processed/aggregated view of the raw API data, enriched with:
- Executive summary and analysis notes
- Change type classification (resolved, modified, new)
- Consolidated related items from multiple API calls
- Screenshot filenames for local reference

You'll need to implement your own logic to process the raw API responses into this format based on your project's specific needs.

## Usage Tips

### Viewing Clash Details
1. Navigate to the **Clashes** tab
2. Click any row in the table to view full details in the right panel
3. Hover over rows to see screenshot previews
4. Use filters and search to narrow down results

### Reviewing by Documentation Type
1. Navigate to the **Related** tab
2. Filter by RFIs, Change Orders, Forms, or Assets
3. Click any related item to see all associated clashes
4. Use this view to identify documentation gaps

### Generating Reports
1. Navigate to the **Report** tab for a narrative view
2. Use the **Print / Save PDF** button to export
3. The report includes executive summary, detailed findings, and recommendations

### Updating Data
1. Click the **Update** button to upload a new JSON file
2. Or simply drag and drop a JSON file onto the page
3. The dashboard will refresh automatically with new data
