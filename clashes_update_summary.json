    "executive_summary": "There are nine clash issues reviewed in this coordination cycle. Four have been resolved — one linked to an open RFI nearing its due date (Oct 29, 2025), one linked to a $100k Change Order, and another tied to a draft Mechanical Inspection form requiring completion. Two issues remain modified with open RFIs (one due Nov 3, 2025) or model updates awaiting review. Three new clashes were detected without supporting RFIs or forms, suggesting potential new interferences introduced in the latest model update. Immediate actions: follow up on the two RFIs before their due dates, ensure the Mechanical Inspection form is finalized, and confirm approval of the Change Order. Review the three new clashes in the next coordination meeting to determine if they persist after the next model sync."
